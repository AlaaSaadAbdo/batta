This board has PCBA files. So it the following components can be assembled by the factory:
- Diodes
- Shift register
- Down facing LEDs (ws2812b)
- FPCs (For attaching Cirque or another pointing device)

BOM:
- 1x Helios MCU (to get all features) 
  - Any RP2040 other MCU with the bottom 5 pains available could also be used but that will lead to losing the top right encoder
- 1x PWM3360 sensor and its lense
- 2x encoders
- 1x Scroll ring encoder
- 1x Pimoroni Haptic feedback board (optional, needs a separate case files WIP)
- 1x WaveShare 1.47inch LCD Display Module 172x320 (optional, needs a separate case file)
- 43x SK6812 Mini-E RGB SMD Led  (optional)
